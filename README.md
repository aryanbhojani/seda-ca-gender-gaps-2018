# seda-ca-gender-gaps-2018
Exploratory analysis of 2018 SEDA data for California school districts quantifying math and reading gender achievement gaps and how they relate to district socioeconomic context.

This project uses the Stanford Education Data Archive (SEDA) to explore gender achievement gaps across California school districts in 2018. I compute district-level gender gaps in standardized test score estimates for two subjects:

- Reading (RLA)
- Math (MTH)

Definition used throughout:
- gender gap = male mean - female mean
- positive gap means boys score higher on average
- negative gap means girls score higher on average

I then examine how these gaps relate to district socioeconomic context (income, poverty, unemployment, SNAP, and a composite SES index), and how patterns vary by grade and locale.
